This repository demonstrates a potential issue in Scala class design. The `MyClass` utilizes a private `var` with public getter and setter methods.  While seemingly straightforward, this approach can mask internal state modifications, leading to unexpected behavior and making code harder to reason about. The example shows exception handling, but the core issue is design.  A better approach would be to use immutable data structures or a more controlled way to handle state changes, possibly using a `case class` and methods for updates.
